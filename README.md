Google Capstone Project in R-Studio cloud :  Fitbit tracker data analysis

Project Idea : This was the last course in the 8 course Google Data Analytics certification course conducted by Coursera in collaboration with Google. A case study was provided with the target of executing all steps in a typical Data analytics project. Since the precedding course #7 was R-programming in R Studio Cloud, I decided to do the Case study also in R.

Resources used: Coursera certification course :  https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics

Data Source : In the form of a series of csv files was provided in the Coursera Case study

Tools used : R Studio cloud and Visual Studio Code

ANALYSIS STEPS:

ASK - Problem description and SOW (see document : Scope of Work)

PREPARE - Data collection and organization (see document : Data Structure) Data source downloaded from Coursera. Created dataframes by reading in all the csv files into the R Studio environment. 

PROCESS - Data cleaning and transformation done in R  (see document : Data Cleaning) - checking for duplicates, zero values, improbable data, data formatting etc..

ANALYZE - Created some co-relation plots using ggplot functionality in R and various charts to gain insights into trends  (see R-script :  Bellabeat_Analysis.R)

SHARE - Summarized findings, conclusions and recommendations in a presentation
